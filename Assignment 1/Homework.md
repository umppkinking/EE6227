## Question 1:
Compute a simulated GA on the Ackley's function for n=3. Do a simulation by hand exercise showing 3 generations for 10-bit pervariable binary coded GA with population size of 10. Your simulation should demonstrate the selection mechanism at work plus the mutation and recombination operators. Use the table on the right for random number generation.  

## Question 2:
Based on the C++ code of a simple GA and answer the questions.
